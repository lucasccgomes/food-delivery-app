Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the
body of a function component. This could happen for
one of the following reasons:

1. You might have mismatching versions of React and
the renderer (such as React DOM)

2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks

3. You might have more than one copy of React in the
same app

See https://react.dev/link/invalid-hook-call for tips
about how to debug and fix this problem.
